# BAwiki-DB
This is the github repo for the bwiki page of Blue Archive. The main purpose of this repo is to host the types of files that cannot be uploaded to bwiki, such as ttf font files and mp3 voice lines. There will also be backups of data and other images, but they will be updated less frequently.
